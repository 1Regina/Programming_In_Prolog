Refer to 01.Tutorial_Introduction/sister.pl for both these 2 questions:

Q1.2) The 2 answers are:

?- sister_of(alice,X).
X = edward ;
X = alice.

i) The other answer is found by looking through the database for female(alice). bcos it is the first argument of sister_of(alice,X) and going through the rule of sister_of
ii) After that, it looks for parents(alice,M,F) and rest a parents(alice,victoria,albert). first via parents(alice,victoria,F) and eventually unifying at parents(alice,victoria,albert)
iii) the 3rd goal is parents(Y, victoria,albert) unifies with parents(alice,victoria,albert) and now variable Y is known as alice.
iv) all goals succeed and entire rule succeeds, with X = alice,and Y = alice. Since Y in the rule is shared with X in the question, then X is also instantiated to alice so Prolog display X = alice.

Q1.3) See 

Q1.4) See above.
To avoid some object being her own sister, add to the sister_of rule a fact: diff(X,Y).

sister_of(X, Y) :-
    female(X),
    parents(X, M, F),
    parents(Y, M, F),
    diff(X,Y).          /* X and Y are different */
